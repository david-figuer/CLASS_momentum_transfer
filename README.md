# CLASS with Dark Energy–Dark Matter Elastic Interaction (Legacy Version)

⚠️ **THIS IS A LEGACY / ARCHIVED VERSION — NOT UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** ⚠️

This repository branch contains an **old implementation** of the Dark Energy–Dark Matter elastic momentum-transfer model based on **CLASS v2.7.2**.

👉 **For all practical purposes, users should use the current implementation based on CLASS v3.3.4**, available in the main branch of this repository:

**Current version (recommended):**  
https://github.com/david-figuer/CLASS_momentum_transfer

---

## Status of this version

- **Status:** Legacy / archived  
- **Maintenance:** ❌ Not maintained  
- **Bug fixes:** ❌ No  
- **New features:** ❌ No  
- **Compatibility:** CLASS v2.7.2  

This version is preserved **for reproducibility purposes only**, e.g.:
- comparison with early results,
- validation of previously published analyses,
- archival reference.

---

## Relation to the current version

This legacy implementation predates the current version of the code and was developed before the migration to newer CLASS releases.

The **actively maintained version**, with improved structure, updated CLASS base (v3.3.4), and a clearer implementation, is available at:

👉 **https://github.com/david-figuer/CLASS_momentum_transfer**

Users are **strongly encouraged** to use the current version instead of this one.

## Origin and attribution

This code is a **modified version of CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System)**.

CLASS is originally developed by:
- Julien Lesgourgues  
- Thomas Tram  
- Nils Schoeneberg

*On structure formation from a small-scales-interacting dark sector*,  
arXiv:1902.05532.

In addition, users must cite the original CLASS reference:
